### About Us
We are a dedicated team of four undergraduate students from the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka, specializing in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering. Our Final Year Project (FYP) is an ambitious endeavor aimed at creating a cutting-edge system involving a drone equipped with a robotic arm, capable of performing precise manipulations using RTK GPS and computer vision technology.

### Project Overview
The primary goal of our project is to develop a sophisticated aerial manipulator system. This involves a drone with a specially designed three-link robot arm that can autonomously navigate to a specified location, leverage RTK GPS for accurate positioning, employ computer vision algorithms for object detection and tracking, perform precise manipulations, and finally return to its starting point.

### Project Components
1. **Robot Arm Design:** We are designing and building a secure three-link robot arm that seamlessly integrates with a multirotor drone.

2. **RTK GPS Integration:** The project incorporates RTK GPS technology to enhance the location accuracy of the drone, ensuring precise navigation during its missions.

3. **Computer Vision on Raspberry Pi:** Utilizing Raspberry Pi, we are implementing advanced computer vision algorithms for object detection and tracking, enabling the drone to identify and interact with objects in its environment.

4. **Autonomous Control Algorithms:** The development of autonomous control algorithms is crucial for coordinating the movements of both the multirotor and the robotic arm. This includes path planning, trajectory generation, and real-time adjustments.

5. **Experimental Testing:** To validate the effectiveness of our system, we will conduct thorough experimental tests covering aspects such as accuracy, stability, power consumption, and the success rate of object grasping.
